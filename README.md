# Pneumatic-Dynamometer
- Developed a bespoke test fixture used to apply a given speed and torque to a drive system
- Utilized a pneumatic cylinder to provide a linear force which was transmitted to the motor via a rack and pinion system. The pressurizing of the cyclinder was coordinated with the motor controller to alterante loading for each cycle
- Coordinated testing and created test report validating performance of drive system
